# Project Overview.
In this project, we aim to assist application developers with actionable data insights on which applications to develop based on user preference and which apps are most prefered by google play store and app store users. Focus is on developing apps that are free to install and use and the main stream of revenue is on in-app ads. We will first read the data and clean it. A thorough analysis of the most preffered apps based on total number of ratings and downloads is done.
